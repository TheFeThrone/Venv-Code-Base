# Venv Code Base

## What is this?

Have you ever wanted to automatically run a programm inside a ``venv``?  
Well I had this problem and decided to implement something that fits this purpose.  
This is a default code that can be edited to fit your purposes

## How to start?

1. Create a ``venv`` inside this repository 
 - ``python -m venv <venv name>``  
   - **default** venv name: ``.venv`` 
   - **if** different name: change line 6 in [launch.py](launch.py#L6)
2. Use [main.py](main.py) as your main file
3. Run [launch.py](launch.py) in ~~terminal~~[*](#Make it runnable via terminal) or VSCode Run Button ![VSCode Run Button](https://github.com/TheFeThrone/Venv-Code-Base/assets/117587855/ead93f3e-13df-425e-8c95-cf39f0f918fd)

## Problems

- For now it's only working if you press the RUN button in VSCode ![VSCode Run Button](https://github.com/TheFeThrone/Venv-Code-Base/assets/117587855/ead93f3e-13df-425e-8c95-cf39f0f918fd) [*](#1)
